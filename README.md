# MNIST_Digit_Using_CNN_Scratch
Image classification using MNIST dataset with Neural Network model constructed from the scratch

This Jupyter notebook has four models ranging from basic - to - Advanced model structure. 
1) Neural Network with single layer of neurons(784) ***Single class classification*** - Accuracy - 99%
2) Neural Network with single layer of neurons(784) + hidden layer ***Single class classification*** - Accuracy - 99% 
3) Neural Network with single layer of neurons(784) + hidden layer ***Multi-class classification*** - Accuracy - 92%
4) Neural Network with single layer of neurons(784) + hidden layer + softmax with forward propagation ***multi-class classification*** - Accuracy - 97%
